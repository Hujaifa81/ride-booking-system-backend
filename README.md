## 📋 Project Overview

A production-ready, scalable Node.js/Express TypeScript backend for a comprehensive ride-hailing platform. This system manages user authentication, driver/vehicle management, real-time ride requests, intelligent driver matching, automated job scheduling, analytics, and reporting with MongoDB geospatial queries and Socket.IO real-time communication.

Backend is designed with enterprise-grade architecture featuring modular design patterns, role-based access control, automated business logic handling, and comprehensive error management for reliable production deployment.

> **Distance Calculation:** Uses the Haversine formula to calculate accurate distances (in kilometers) between geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) for precise fare calculations and driver matching logic.

## 🎯 Business Logic & Rules

### 🚫 Automatic Ride Cancellation
- **No Driver Available**: Rides automatically cancelled after 10 minutes if no driver found
- **Driver Timeout**: If driver doesn't respond within 5 minutes, ride reassigned to next nearest driver
- **Pending Ride Retry**: System retries driver assignment every 30 seconds for pending rides
- **Complete Workflow**: Requested → Pending (if no driver) → Auto-cancel (after 10 min) OR Reassign to new driver

### 👤 Manual Ride Cancellation
- **Rider Cancellation**: Can cancel before driver arrives or ride starts
- **Driver Cancellation**: Can cancel accepted rides with valid reason
- **Cancellation Tracking**: All cancellations recorded in status history with timestamp and reason
- **Policy Enforcement**: Both riders and drivers tracked separately

### ⏱️ Driver Response Management
- **Response Window**: 5 minutes to accept or reject ride request
- **Timeout Action**: Automatic reassignment to next available driver
- **Notification System**: Real-time Socket.IO notifications for new requests
- **Request Tracking**: Driver added to rejected list for that specific ride

### 🚦 Ride Status Lifecycle
Complete ride workflow with status transitions:
1. **REQUESTED** - Initial ride creation
2. **PENDING** - No driver available, system searching
3. **ACCEPTED** - Driver accepted the ride
4. **GOING_TO_PICK_UP** - Driver en route to pickup location
5. **DRIVER_ARRIVED** - Driver reached pickup point
6. **IN_TRANSIT** - Ride in progress
7. **REACHED_DESTINATION** - Arrived at drop-off location
8. **COMPLETED** - Ride finished, payment processed
9. **CANCELLED_BY_RIDER** / **CANCELLED_BY_DRIVER** / **CANCELLED_BY_SYSTEM** - Various cancellation states

### 📵 Cancellation Policy & User Blocking
- **Daily Limit**: Maximum 3 cancellations per day per user/driver
- **Automatic Block**: System blocks user/driver for 24 hours after reaching limit
- **New Request Restriction**: Cannot request new rides after reaching cancellation limit
- **Reset**: Counter resets at midnight daily
- **Tracking Window**: Counts cancellations from 00:00 to 23:59 each day

### 💵 Dynamic Fare Calculation
- **Base Components**:
  - Base fare: 50
  - Per kilometer: 25
  - Per minute: 5 (estimated at 40 km/h average speed)
  
- **Surge Pricing**:
  - Demand-based surge: Calculated from active rides vs available drivers ratio
  - Time-based surge: Peak hours (7-10 AM, 5-8 PM), weekends, holidays
  - Combined multiplier: (1 + demandSurge) × (1 + timeSurge)
  
- **Penalty System**:
  - Triggered if ride duration exceeds expected time
  - Expected time calculated: (distance / 40 km/h) × 60 minutes
  - Penalty rate: ₹10 per extra minute
  - Added to final fare

- **Driver Earnings**: 75% of total fare (including penalties)
- **Display**: Approximate fare shown before ride confirmation

### 🔍 Nearest Driver Matching Algorithm
1. Search drivers within 5 km radius of pickup location
2. Filter by: Available status, Approved, No active ride, Not suspended, Active user account
3. Exclude: Drivers who previously rejected this ride
4. Sort by: Distance from pickup (nearest first)
5. Return: Closest matching driver
6. If none found: Set ride to PENDING, retry every 30 seconds

### 📊 Location-Based Features
- **Driver Search Radius**: 5 km maximum
- **Geospatial Indexing**: MongoDB 2dsphere for efficient location queries
- **Real-time Updates**: Drivers can update location anytime
- **Pickup Validation**: Prevents same pickup and drop-off locations

### ⭐ Rating & Feedback System
- **Post-Ride Only**: Ratings allowed after ride completion
- **Mutual Ratings**: Riders rate drivers (future feature: drivers rate riders)
- **Feedback Storage**: Comments and ratings stored with ride
- **Reputation Impact**: Affects driver visibility and matching priority

### 🔐 Pre-Ride Validations
- **Phone Verification**: Riders must have phone number in profile
- **Active Ride Check**: Users cannot have multiple concurrent rides
- **Daily Cancellation Check**: Blocks requests if limit reached
- **Location Validation**: Ensures valid pickup/drop-off coordinates
- **Driver Availability**: Only approved, non-suspended, available drivers matched

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

### 🗄️ Database Setup

The application uses MongoDB with geospatial indexing for location-based queries. Ensure your MongoDB instance supports 2dsphere indexes.

**Automatic Index Creation**: Mongoose will automatically create required indexes on first run.

**Manual Index Creation** (if needed):
```javascript
db.drivers.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
```

### 🔧 Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server with auto-reload |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to JavaScript |
| `npm start` | Start production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint on source code |
| `npm test` | Run tests (not yet implemented) |

### 🌱 Seeding Data

The application automatically seeds an admin user on first run in development mode:

- **Email**: admin@example.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: Admin

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: Change default admin credentials immediately in production!

### 🧪 Testing the API

You can test the API using:
- **Postman**: Import endpoints and test with proper authentication
- **cURL**: Command-line testing
- **Frontend App**: Connect to the frontend application

**Base URL**: 
- Development: `http://localhost:5000/api/v1`
- Production: `https://ride-booking-backend-six.vercel.app/api/v1`

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### Modular Architecture
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic separated from controllers
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction through Mongoose models
- **Middleware Pattern**: Reusable request processing pipeline
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic error handler creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple fare calculation strategies

### Key Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusable utilities and helpers
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open-closed, etc.
- **Error-First Approach**: Comprehensive error handling at every layer
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage

### Code Organization
Each feature module follows this structure:
```
module/
├── module.interface.ts     # TypeScript interfaces
├── module.model.ts         # Mongoose schema & model
├── module.validation.ts    # Zod validation schemas
├── module.controller.ts    # Request handlers
├── module.service.ts       # Business logic
├── module.route.ts         # Express routes
└── module.constants.ts     # Module-specific constants
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. MongoDB Connection Error**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017
```
**Solution**: Ensure MongoDB is running. Check DB_URL in `.env`

**2. Google OAuth Not Working**
```
Error: Callback URL mismatch
```
**Solution**: Update Google Cloud Console with correct callback URL

**3. CORS Error**
```
Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy
```
**Solution**: Add your frontend URL to `allowedOrigins` in [app.ts](src/app.ts)

**4. Socket.IO Connection Failed**
```
WebSocket connection failed
```
**Solution**: Ensure Socket.IO client matches server version. Check CORS settings.

**5. Geospatial Queries Not Working**
```
Error: unable to find index for $geoNear query
```
**Solution**: Create 2dsphere index on driver location field:
```javascript
db.drivers.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })
```
